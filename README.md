# ECEN-361-STM32-Lab-06-ADC-PWM-Solution


## BYU-I  Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering

## Overview / Purpose
The purpose of this lab is to introduce the student to ADC, DAC, and PWM.   This will be done using FreeRTOS and several tasks will be running concurrently. The ADC, PWM, UART, and FReeRTOS are automatically configured within this IDE via the STM32MX tool (as brought up by the .ioc file).

All of the lab will start from a pre-built STM32 'Project.'  If you're reading this, you've probably already accepted and cloned the project into your STM32CubeIDE workspace.  If you need help do that, see the instructions [HERE](./Documentation/Working_with_Labs_from_Github_Classroom_Repository.pdf).

Open and follow the instructions found in the Markdown (*.md) document in your cloned repo: 

>./Documentation/Assignment.md

Modify the document with answers when finished, then commit your repository to github. The commit will upload this document as well and serves as the lab submission.

The final part of the assignment is to paste the URL of this repo into the iLearn Assignment.
